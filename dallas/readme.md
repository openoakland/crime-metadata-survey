Description per [OpenNews/hackdays/insideroutsider](https://wiki.mozilla.org/OpenNews/hackdays/insideroutsider)

> This is an enormous, underutilized cache of crime data. Chicago gets lots of attention and plaudits for their crime data, but the Dallas stuff goes even farther back (2000!) and contains narrative that will make your eyes bleed. They have the actual comments typed into the system by actual police officers, including graphic details about horrible crimes and a huge amount of profanity. This is a researcher's treasure chest.
