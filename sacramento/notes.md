Because this data is produced via a complex set of processes, there are many places where errors can be introduced into the data that you will be downloading. The margin of error in this data is approximately 10%. Please keep this in mind when working with these data extracts. No representation is made or implied regarding the accuracy of the data being made available.

It is against State law (Government Code Section 6254) for us to provide victim's addresses for certain classes of crimes (mainly rape, sex or abuse-related crimes). Since the address field in the data extracts is usually that of the victim, it has been blanked out for the affected crime types. You can still research activity for those types of crimes, but location information will be limited to district, beat, or grid. This applies to the following crimes:

220 - Attempted Rape
261 - Rape
262 - Rape
264 - Rape
273 - Domestic Violence/ Child Neglect
286 - Sodomy
288 - Other Sex Crimes
289 - Other Sex Crimes
422 - Terrorist Threats
646.9 - Stalking

Most law enforcement agencies have pre-defined areas for assignment and reporting purposes. For many years, the Sacramento Police Department has named these areas Sectors, Districts, and EDP's (Electronic Data Processing districts). In 2006, these areas were renamed. Sectors are now called Districts, Districts are now called Beats, and EDP's are called Grids. Districts are the largest of the areas; the City is divided into 6 Districts. The Districts are divided into Beats, which are assigned to Patrol officers. The Beats are divided into Grids for reporting purposes. Over the years, the various boundaries have changed, but the Grids have not changed significantly. As confusing as this all sounds, this information will be necessary when working with the data extracts. See the City of Sacramento Maps section in the database links below to download city maps showing the major streets, neighborhoods, EDP grids, districts, and beats.
